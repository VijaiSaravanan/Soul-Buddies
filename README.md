Domain: Artificial Intelligence ; Problem Statement: Develop an AI powered chatbot that can provide mental health support to users

Abstract: Personalized chatbot implemented using AI takes in users inputs as text or speech to text format. The data of daily interactions are stored in the database to make the replies provided by the bot to be suited to the user. The user interactions are used in determining the condition of the user and is classified between good,bad, and very bad. The replies made by the bot varies with the classification. In case when the user’s condition is classified as very bad the location of the person is shared with the close contact through mail along with an alert stating the patient’s mental condition and the steps to be taken. Very bad classification is for severe issues and requires offline health support. The data from the database can be utilised by the medical advior. Apart from normal and simple health support the bot has been developed to provide Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy(CBT). It greets the user with positive quotes and affirmations on regular intervals to lift the person’s mood. It can also provide healthcare support if the person suffers from a disease. It provides a daily routine to follow and also reminds them about their medication. At the end of the day the bot asks few lines obout their day to have a record on their daily lifestyle.
